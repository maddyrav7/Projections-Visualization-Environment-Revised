# Projections-Visualization-Environment-Revised
Revised version of old repository. A set of orthographic projection exercises for University of Waterloo Engineering students taking ME/MTE 100.

## What is the Projections Visualization Environment?
The Projections Visualization Environment is a program for Windows and Mac made using the Godot video game engine that contains exercises for students taking ME/MTE 100 at the University of Waterloo. It is meant to improve students' ability to imagine and project 3D shapes onto 2D drawings without physical objects, through four exercises focused on orthographic projections and engineering drawings in third angle projection. These exercises are based on the visualization techniques in the course notes. The program was written in C#, and the exported programs can be found in the "Exports" folder. For the Windows version, there is a zip file containing the exported program files, called "Projections.zip". The Mac version contains a similar zip file, called "Projections_Mac.zip". The scripts and assets I created can be found in the "Scripts" and "Assets" folders respectively. Demo videos for the project can also be found in the "Demos" folder.
